# Vagal Harmonics
EMF and nervous system remediation with scientific and philosophical principles belonging to a new technological paradigm.

## Vagal Harmonics — Core Founding Claim

Date of Origin: August 10, 2025

Founded by Robert Castellanos, Vagal Harmonics is an open-science, copyleft system combining electromagnetic field (EMF) remediation across human environments—homes, workplaces, and schools. It pairs this with low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) vagal stimulation to harmonize nervous system function and promote autonomic balance.

Rooted in the vision of a self-operating mathematical universe (SOMU), Vagal Harmonics embraces fractal mechanics as the emerging scientific framework revealing the fundamental nature of reality and the origins of quantum laws. This foundation points toward the development of advanced, life-supporting hardware and machines.

Vagal Harmonics is the vessel which guides users toward a new paradigm where nonviolence thrives, life flourishes, and healing technologies are open and accessible to all.
