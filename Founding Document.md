Core Definition  
Vagal Harmonics is a copyleft, open-science framework for restoring nervous system health by:  
1. Reducing harmful electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure in occupations, homes, and 
schools.  
2. Enhancing vagal tone through targeted resonance and Low-Intensity Pulsed 
Ultrasound (LIPUS) stimulation.  
The system integrates environmental EMF remediation with precise, non-invasive stimulation 
protocols designed to harmonize vagus nerve function, regulate autonomic balance, and 
support long-term well-being.  
Core Principles  
3. EMF Remediation as Primary Health Intervention — Identification, measurement, and 
removal/reduction of chronic EMF exposure from Wi-Fi, 5G, dirty electricity, and other 
anthropogenic sources.  
4. LIPUS-Enhanced Vagal Toning — Application of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound to 
specific cervical and auricular regions to stimulate vagal pathways and improve 
parasympathetic activity.  
5. Harmonic Integration — Combining LIPUS with breathing cycles, acoustic harmonics, 
or gentle vibration to enhance neurophysiological coherence.  
6. Occupational & Educational Applications — Designing protocols and environmental 
standards for workplaces and schools to support nervous system health and cognitive 
performance.  
7. Open Scientific Collaboration — All methods, results, and refinements remain openly 
available for replication, adaptation, and further research.  
Initial Methods / Applications  
8. EMF Environmental Survey — Measuring ambient EMFs in the home, workplace, or 
school using professional-grade meters, documenting sources, and implementing 
shielding, grounding, or device removal.  
9. LIPUS Application — Applying low-intensity pulsed ultrasound transducers to the vagus 
regions for 5–10 minutes at scientifically determined parameters to stimulate vagal 
activity.  
10. Workplace/School Vagal Recovery Sessions — Implementing daily or weekly 
sessions in EMF-reduced rooms where LIPUS and harmonic practices are used for 
stress reduction and autonomic reset.
